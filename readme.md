## Personal python practice project

The PDF to Json transformation is done over at https://www.pdf2go.com/es
Some slight modifications are required:
* We need to remove all previous info pages, so the document starts with the first pokemon registry
* For the program to recognice the complete text we need to remove the double quotation marks used in the size information section of each pokemon and the ยง symbol from the movelists that have that. (Ctrl+f and replace to delete them all at once)
* After finding a critical problem with the formatting of many TM Move Lists on different pokemon I attempted to re-do the program accessing the data directly with a python PDF reader, it had it's own critical flaws so I decided to come back to this version and manually edit both files in DATA to make sure the TM Move List was a continuous block.
* In the same fashion as the issue with the discontinous TM Move List, some Egg Move Lists mut be edited. Many less tho.
