## Personal python practice project

The PDF to Json transformation is done over at https://www.pdf2go.com/es
Some slight modifications are required:
* We need to remove all previous info pages, so the document starts with the first pokemon registry
* For the program to recognice the complete text we need to remove the double quotation marks used in the size information section of each pokemon and the ยง symbol from the movelists that have that. (Ctrl+f and replace to delete them all at once)
